# Frogger
My bash-scripted spin of a Frogger-like game.  

After learning bash, I wanted to make something fun with it.   
Frogger is a simple, fun CLI game. Play while bored, waiting for a build, or trying to act busy before a meeting starts. 
Written on MacOS, but should work on most Linux systems.  

Quick Start  
  `$ git clone https://github.com/steerzac/Frogger.git`  
  `$ cd Frogger`  
  `$ ./frogger.sh`  
 
 Enjoy!
